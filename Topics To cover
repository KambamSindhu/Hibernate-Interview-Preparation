Got it üëç You want me to be **fair and practical** about the **Hibernate concepts** required for a **Java Full Stack Developer** role.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

---

## üéØ Core Hibernate Concepts (Must-Know for Full Stack Dev)

These are **non-negotiable basics** that every full-stack dev is expected to know:

1. **ORM Basics**

   * What is Hibernate?
   * Advantages over JDBC
   * JPA vs Hibernate

2. **Configuration**

   * Hibernate configuration files (`hibernate.cfg.xml`)
   * Annotation-based configuration (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@Column`)

3. **Mappings**

   * Entity mapping
   * Primary keys (`@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`)
   * Relationships:

     * One-to-One (`@OneToOne`)
     * One-to-Many & Many-to-One (`@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`)
     * Many-to-Many (`@ManyToMany`)
   * Cascading and Fetch Types (Lazy vs Eager loading)

4. **CRUD Operations**

   * `save()`, `update()`, `delete()`, `get()`, `load()`
   * HQL (Hibernate Query Language) basics
   * Criteria API

5. **Transactions & Session**

   * Session lifecycle (open, close, flush, clear)
   * Transaction management (`beginTransaction`, `commit`, `rollback`)

---

## üî• Intermediate (Good-to-Have, Asked in Interviews)

Not every project needs deep Hibernate knowledge, but recruiters test this:

1. **Caching**

   * First-level cache (default)
   * Second-level cache (EhCache, Infinispan)

2. **N+1 Select Problem**

   * What it is, and how `JOIN FETCH` or `EntityGraph` solves it

3. **Inheritance Mapping**

   * Table per class hierarchy
   * Table per subclass
   * Table per concrete class

4. **Criteria & HQL**

   * Named Queries (`@NamedQuery`)
   * JPQL vs HQL
   * Pagination (`setFirstResult`, `setMaxResults`)

---

## üöÄ Advanced (Only if project demands OR for senior roles)

If you‚Äôre aiming for higher packages / architect-level:

* Hibernate with Spring Boot (Spring Data JPA integration)
* Batch Processing & Bulk Updates
* Optimistic & Pessimistic Locking
* Native SQL in Hibernate
* Multi-tenancy in Hibernate
* Performance tuning (Fetch strategies, query optimization)

---

‚úÖ **For full stack dev interviews (2‚Äì4 YOE)**:
Master the **Core + Intermediate** topics. Advanced is usually **bonus points** unless you‚Äôre applying for senior roles.

Would you like me to **make a roadmap (topic ‚Üí hours ‚Üí depth)** for Hibernate so you can cover exactly what‚Äôs needed for your **full stack interview prep by October**?
